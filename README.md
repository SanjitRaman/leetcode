# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## Structure

Each solution is contained in its own directory, named after the problem number and title. For example, the solution to problem 1, "Two Sum", is in the directory `1_two_sum`.

## Usage

Each problem solution is contained in its own C++ file, named after the problem title on LeetCode. To compile and run a solution, navigate to the directory containing the file and use the following commands:

```bash
g++ problem_name.cpp -o problem_name
./problem_name
```

Replace problem_name with the name of the problem. For example, if you're running the solution for the "Two Sum" problem, you would use:

```
g++ two_sum.cpp -o two_sum
./two_sum
```
